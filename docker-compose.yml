    # Network mode options:
    # - Default (bridge): Works for basic usage, but printer discovery and
    #   camera streaming may not work since container can't reach LAN directly.
    # - Host mode: Required for printer discovery scanning and camera streaming.
    #   Uncomment "network_mode: host" and remove "ports:" section below.
