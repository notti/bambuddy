# Changelog

All notable changes to Bambuddy will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.6b] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **Tasmota device discovery** - Automatically discover Tasmota smart plugs on your network. Click "Discover Tasmota Devices" in the Add Smart Plug modal to scan your local subnet. Supports devices with and without authentication.
- **Switchbar for quick smart plug access** - New sidebar widget for controlling smart plugs without leaving the current page. Enable "Show in Switchbar" for any plug to add it to the quick access panel. Shows real-time status, power consumption, and on/off controls.
- **Timelapse editor** - Edit timelapse videos with trim, speed adjustment (0.25x-4x), and music overlay. Uses FFmpeg for server-side processing with browser-based preview.
- **AMS filament preview** - Reprint modal shows filament comparison between what the print requires and what's currently loaded in the AMS. Compares both type and color with visual indicators (green=match, yellow=color mismatch, orange=type mismatch).
- **File type badge** - Archive cards now show GCODE (green) or SOURCE (orange) badge to indicate whether the file is a sliced print-ready file or source-only.
- **Docker printer discovery** - Subnet scanning for discovering printers when running in Docker with `network_mode: host`. Automatically detects Docker environment and shows subnet input field in Add Printer dialog.
- **Printer model mapping** - Discovery now shows friendly model names (X1C, H2D, P1S) instead of raw SSDP codes (BL-P001, O1D, C11).
- **Discovery API tests** - Comprehensive test coverage for discovery endpoints.
- **Project filament colors** - Project cards now display filament color swatches from assigned archives.
- **BOM filter** - Hide completed BOM items with "Hide done" toggle on project detail page.
- **Projects in backup/restore** - Projects, BOM items, and attachments now included in database backup/restore.
- **Attachment file validation** - File type validation for project attachments (images, documents, 3D files, archives, scripts, configs).

### Changed
- **Timelapse viewer** - Default playback speed changed from 2x to 1x.
- **GitHub issue template** - Added mandatory printer firmware version field and LAN-only mode checkbox for better bug reports.
- **Docker compose** - Clearer comments explaining `network_mode: host` requirement for printer discovery and camera streaming.
- **Project card design** - Enhanced visual polish with gradients, shadows, and glow effects on hover.
- **Project page layout** - Improved spacing and padding on project list and detail pages.
- **Delete confirmations** - Replaced browser confirm dialogs with styled confirmation modals.

### Fixed
- **Notification module** - Fixed bug where notifications were sent even when printer was offline.
- **Attachment uploads** - Fixed file attachments not persisting due to SQLAlchemy JSON column mutation detection.
- **Camera stream stability** - Fixed stream stopping after a few minutes by increasing ffmpeg read timeout (10s→30s), adding buffer options, and implementing auto-reconnection with exponential backoff in the frontend.

## [0.1.5] - 2025-12-19

### Fixed
- **Browser freeze on print completion** - Fixed freeze when camera stream was open during print completion by using buffered camera frames instead of spawning duplicate ffmpeg processes
- **Printer status "timelapse" effect** - Fixed issue where navigating to printer page after print showed metrics animating slowly from mid-print values to final state; printer_status messages now bypass the throttled queue
- **Timelapse auto-download** - Complete rewrite with retry mechanism and multiple path support
- **Timelapse detection for H2D** - H2D sends timelapse status in ipcam.timelapse field, not xcam.timelapse
- **Reprint from archive** - Fixed bug where print button sent slicer source file instead of sliced gcode
- **Import shadowing bugs** - Fixed ArchiveService import shadowing causing "cannot access local variable" error
- **Timelapse race condition** - xcam data was parsed before print state was set

### Added
- **Failure reason detection** - Auto-detects failure reasons from HMS errors:
  - Filament runout (Module 0x07)
  - Layer shift (Module 0x0C)
  - Clogged nozzle (Module 0x05)
- **Hide failed prints filter** - Toggle to hide failed/aborted prints with localStorage persistence
- **Docker test suite** - Comprehensive tests for build, backend, frontend, and integration
- **Pre-commit hooks** - Ruff linter and formatter for code quality
- **Code quality tests** - Static analysis to catch import shadowing bugs automatically

### Changed
- **Timelapse viewer** - Default playback speed changed from 0.5x to 2x
- **Archive badges** - Shows "cancelled" for aborted prints, "failed" for failed prints
- **WebSocket optimization** - Removed large raw_data field from print_complete message; reduced throttle to 100ms for smoother updates

### Docker
- Added ffmpeg to Docker image
- Fixed build warnings (debconf, pip root user)
- Added comprehensive Docker documentation to README
- Added `--pull` flag to ensure fresh base images
